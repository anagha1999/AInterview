## Inspiration
Breaking into Product Management can feel like a formidable challenge without the right guidance. The role demands a deep, holistic understanding of business, collaboration across cross-functional teams, and a strong obsession on delivering an exceptional customer experience. There’s no one-size-fits-all formula to measure a candidate’s potential as a product manager, making the path even more intimidating for those without prior experience. Inspired by this gap, we’re driven to provide a solution—one where candidates can upload their resume and the job description of their desired role, and in return, receive a tailored interview experience that helps them effectively prepare, sharpen their skills, and build confidence for their actual interview.

## What it does
Our product allows customers of all backgrounds to interview for PM roles and receive feedback on their interview. We also perform an analysis on the interview transcipts and give feedback on the interview on a scale of 1 to 10.
